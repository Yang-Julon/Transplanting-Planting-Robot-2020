# Transplanting-Planting-Robot-2020
Record the project of the transplanting robot for retroplanting seedlings developed in December 2020.

This project is based on ARMCortex-M4 processor, using A4950 DC motor drive module, JY-901 nine-axis sensor, equipped with US-100 ultrasonic ranging module, TOF02 and TFMINI_PLUS laser ranging module, and Raspberry vision processing system. JX6221 digital steering gear. The chassis uses four deceleration brushed motors with photoelectric encoders to drive four McNum wheels. The chassis motor has a closed-loop speed control, which can achieve smooth driving. Through four ultrasonic ranging and four laser ranging, the robot can keep a certain distance from the ridge wall, and adjust the body posture at any time through the omnidirectional movement characteristics of McNum wheel on the road. A visual recognition system based on OpenCV library is installed on the upper part of the robot. When the replacement position is recognized, the replacement transplanting execution unit on the upper part will place the simulated seedling on the circular replacement position on the ridge back, and then exit horizontally to prepare for the next replacement transplanting operation.
